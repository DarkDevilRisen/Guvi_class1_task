http2:

HTTP/2 supports queries multiplexing, headers compression, priority and more intelligent packet streaming management.
This results in reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.
HTTP 2.0 is a binary protocol that multiplexes numerous streams going over a single TCP connection.


http1:
The contents of each stream are HTTP 1.1 requests and responses, just encoded and packed up differently
The main addition was “request headers” and “response headers.” Also, the new response headers allowed multiple file types, such as HTML, plain text, images, and more.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTTP2 is binary, where as HTTP1 is textual.
HTTP2 is fully multiplexed, instead of ordered and blocking.
HTTP2 can, therefore, use one connection for parallelism.
HTP2 uses header compression to reduce overhead.
HTTP2 allows servers to “push” responses proactively into client caches.
HTTP2 is secured by default.
